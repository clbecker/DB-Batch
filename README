DB-Batch version 0.10
=====================

	DB::Batch is a system for breaking up queries into batches behind the scenes, 
	while maintaining the appearance of running a single query.  
	Queries are run against an instance of DBI.  

	For example, a query like: 

	SELECT * FROM TABLE

	is expressed as:

	SELECT * FROM TABLE WHERE id BETWEEN # AND #

	and would be executed as:

	SELECT * FROM TABLE WHERE id BETWEEN 1 AND 100
	SELECT * FROM TABLE WHERE id BETWEEN 101 AND 200
	SELECT * FROM TABLE WHERE id BETWEEN 201 AND 300
	...

	Until the MAX(id) is reached.

	The script running this query, however, acts as if you are just 
	running 'SELECT * FROM TABLE'.

	The purpose of this is to diminish load on a sql database when large amounts of
	data need to be retrieved by managing batch size and throttling.
